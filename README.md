Hi, I’m @lukavr05

I am a Second Year student at Royal Holloway, University of London studying BSc Computer Science and Information Security!

I am fascinated by the application of DNNs and Machine Learning in the field of Cryptography and the implications/applications that they have.

My technical experience includes:
  - Java      - HTML
  - Python    - CSS
  - Go        - C
